{"name":"CivOne","tagline":"An open source implementation of Sid Meier's Civilization","body":"# About this project\r\nCivOne is an effort to recreate the original Sid Meier's Civilization game in C#, using the original resource files. The project primary goal is to end up with an exact copy, including all the bugs/features/limitations. Later on, we might add multiplayer, bigger maps and modding support, but that's not our focus at the moment.\r\n\r\n# News\r\n## 1 June 2015:\r\nLot's of progress. The new game menu is working. The game generates random maps with the original Civilization algorithm. I've even got the original random number generator implemented. Load games are working. Gameplay screen is being implemented, showing the full map including coast/river animations. World map screen is working. Started working on the Civilopedia.\r\nI can confirm that CivOne works on Linux, but not on MacOS X. I'm going to fix that before the release of the first version.\r\n## 19 May 2015:\r\nThe credits, main menu, customize world and intro screens are fully implemented. There's also a setup screen, making it easier to change the game settings. I'm almost ready to get to work on the gameplay.\r\nIf you find any bugs, please report them to the issue tracker: <https://github.com/SWY1985/CivOne/issues>\r\n## 12 May 2015:\r\nI've created an initial version of CivOne and created a Visual Studio Code project. The project currently compiles and runs on Windows and Linux. I have not tested MacOS X but I don't expect any problems there.\r\nI will be merging my old code with the new CivOne project this week.\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n## How to build/run CivOne?\r\nPlease refer to the [Wiki page](https://github.com/SWY1985/CivOne/wiki/How-to-build-and-run-CivOne%3F).\r\n\r\n## What do the folders/files in this project mean?\r\nPlease refer to the [Wiki page](https://github.com/SWY1985/CivOne/wiki/Project-files-folders).\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\nYou can contact me/discuss CivOne in the forum thread on Civfanatics.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Links\r\n* CivOne Wiki: <https://github.com/SWY1985/CivOne/wiki>\r\n* Issue Tracker: <https://github.com/SWY1985/CivOne/issues>\r\n* Forum thread: <http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=535036>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
