{"name":"CivOne","tagline":"An open source implementation of Sid Meier's Civilization","body":"### About this project\r\nCivOne is an effort to recreate the original Sid Meier's Civilization game in C#, using the original resource files. The project primary goal is to end up with an exact copy, including all the bugs/features/limitations. Later on, we might add multiplayer, bigger maps and modding support, but that's not our focus at the moment.\r\n\r\n### News\r\n## 12 May 2015:\r\nI've created an initial version of CivOne and created a Visual Studio Code project. The project currently compiles and runs on Windows and Linux. I have not tested MacOS X but I don't expect any problems there.\r\nI will be merging my old code with the new CivOne project this week.\r\n\r\n### How to build/run CivOne?\r\nCivOne is being developed for .NET 4.0/Mono and it is intended to run on Windows, MacOS X and Linux. To build/run CivOne, you need the following:\r\n* Visual Studio Code: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>\r\n* .NET Framework 4.0 (Windows only): <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851>\r\n* Mono (Linux, MacOS, optional on Windows): <http://www.mono-project.com/>\r\n\r\nAfter you've downloaded and installed the proper tools you can download or clone CivOne.\r\nIn Visual Studio Code, choose File > Open Folder...\r\nChoose the folder where you downloaded CivOne.\r\nNow follow the platform specific instructions.\r\n\r\n## Windows\r\n* Debugging is not yet supported in Windows.\r\n* I have not tested this project in Visual Studio, only in Visual Studio Code, but it will probably work in Visual Studio without any issues.\r\n* You can change the compiler by editing the \"args\" setting in ~/.settings/tasks.json. You can choose msbuild (.NET) or xbuild (Mono).\r\n* You should have a PATH reference to msbuild (for .NET) or xbuild (for Mono). Open Computer Properties > Advanced system settings > Enviromental variables.\r\n\t- msbuild: Add \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\12.0\\Bin\" (or similar, try to find MSBuild.exe in explorer) to the PATH variable\r\n\t- xbuild: Add \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mono\\bin\" (or similar, try to find xbuild.bat in explorer) to the PATH variable\r\n\tYou need to restart Visual Studio Code for the PATH settings to work.\r\n* To build, press Ctrl+Shift+B\r\n* To run, press Ctrl+Shift+T\r\n* Alternatively, you can run build.bat from the command-line:\r\n\t- To compile: build [msbuild|xbuild] build\r\n\t- To run: build [msbuild|xbuild] run\r\n\r\n## Linux\r\n* Visual Studio Code is currently only available for 64-bit Linux on Intel processors.\r\n* You need to change the file ~/.settings/tasks.json to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n        \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n        \"command\": \"xbuild,\r\n        \"args\": [\"CivOne.csproj\"]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n* To compile the project, press Ctrl+Shift+B.\r\n* You can run and debug, the project by pressing F5, or by clicking the Debug icon in the toolbar (left) and pressing the Play button.\r\n\r\n## MacOS X\r\nI do not own a Mac so I can not test this at the moment. If you've managed to get the project running on MacOS, please let me know how you did it so I can add instructions to the website.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nYou can contact me/discuss CivOne in the forum thread on Civfanatics.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n* CivOne Wiki: <https://github.com/SWY1985/CivOne/wiki>\r\n* Forum thread: <http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=535036>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
