{"name":"CivOne","tagline":"An open source implementation of Sid Meier's Civilization","body":"# About this project\r\nCivOne is an effort to recreate the original Sid Meier's Civilization game in C#, using the original resource files. The project primary goal is to end up with an exact copy, including all the bugs/features/limitations. Later on, we might add multiplayer, bigger maps and modding support, but that's not our focus at the moment.\r\n\r\n# News\r\n## 12 May 2015:\r\nI've created an initial version of CivOne and created a Visual Studio Code project. The project currently compiles and runs on Windows and Linux. I have not tested MacOS X but I don't expect any problems there.\r\nI will be merging my old code with the new CivOne project this week.\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n## How to build/run CivOne?\r\nPlease refer to the [Wiki page](https://github.com/SWY1985/CivOne/wiki/How-to-build-run-CivOne%3F).\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\nYou can contact me/discuss CivOne in the forum thread on Civfanatics.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Links\r\n* CivOne Wiki: <https://github.com/SWY1985/CivOne/wiki>\r\n* Forum thread: <http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=535036>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
